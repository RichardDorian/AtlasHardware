# AtlasHardware

This is a college project where we had to use skills we learned (HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL). My team and I decided to make a website where people could share computer builds. Due to the short amount of time we didn't entirely finish this project but still got a basic version of the website working.

## Features

We wanted people to be able to:

> [!NOTE]  
> Features in *italic* are not yet implemented.

- Write computer build pages (internally named posts)
- Comment on those posts *(and reply to other comments)*
- Search posts based on post content
- *Rate posts*
- *See other people's profile*

## What did we learn?

The hardest part was to conceive a good project structure to make easier feature implementation. We settled for something that may be unseen, and it probably has some major flaws but we consider it good enough for our use case and adequat considering we are new to PHP developement.
