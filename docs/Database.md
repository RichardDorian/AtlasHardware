# Database

Here's a quick overview of the database system we use for the project.

## Software

We use MySQL. Being what is promoted by the school we didn't have much of a choice. It's a good system, though.

## Tables

## Setup

In order to set up the database, you first need to set the proper environment variables. They can be modified in the `.htaccess` file. You must set a secure `ADMIN_KEY`. This key is required everytime you want to make a change to the database. Also make sure to set the host, username, password and database name. If there's no password (in the case of a local server), you can comment the line using a `#`.

When this is done, you can open `/admin/database/setup`, enter the admin key and click on `Setup database`. This will create the database and the tables.

> [!WARNING]  
> If there's already a database with the same name, it will be dropped and replaced by a new one. Make sure to backup your data if needed before doing this.
