# Database

Here's a quick overview of the database system we use for the project.

## Software

We use MariaDB. Being what is promoted by the school we didn't have much of a choice. It's a good system, though.

## Tables

We have currently two tables, `users` and `posts`.

### Users

| Field    | Type          | Description                                                                                 |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id       | `UUID`        | A unique identifier for the user. Generated by the server on sign up.                       |
| username | `VARCHAR(20)` | The username of the user. Has a maximum length of 20 characters.                            |
| password | `VARCHAR`     | The password of the user. Encrypted with bcrypt.                                            |
