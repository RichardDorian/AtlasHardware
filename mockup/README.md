This mock-up shows the most useful pages on the site, omitting pages that are basically the same and useless.

There are only the 4 most useful pages: 
- the home page
- the login page
- the page for adding a post
- the page for viewing a post in detail.


Most of the site's features and links are disabled, as this is a mock-up.
